Curent_Draw_Test - Old test code.

UART Test Code - This is flashed to the companion microcontroller to send via UART as explained in the testing section of the interface subsystem.

UART_Comms - This is the code flashed to the main microcontroller to receive via UART as explained in the testing section of the interface subsystem.

sheetscript.js - This is the code written to the Google Scripts API that performs all functionality within the Google Suite used in the project for the interface subsystem.

## MITIGATION SUBSYSTEM
Test - Contains code used to test connection to Arduino UNO.

Mitigate_Subsystem_Code - Contains the code used to create the Mitigation Subsystem.
